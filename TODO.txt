TO-DO LIST
- create sample data and populate the db with it
- create sample controller
- create sample views


FUTURE STUFF
- handle access to controllers
	could it be handled to add controler_name to the resource table and verify against that?? We don't have a resource_id on the controller.... so.. how to approach this
